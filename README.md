# AI Calling Agent - RupeeQ Assignment

## Overview
An **Agentic AI Solution** for automated customer calling in financial services. This AI agent handles customer interactions for Bajaj Finance's Flexi Overdraft Facility, speaking in English with authentic Indian accent and natural Hindi phrases.

Built using **LiveKit Agents Framework** - a modern agentic AI platform for creating autonomous, real-time conversational agents that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments.

## 🤖 Agentic AI Architecture

### What Makes This "Agentic AI":
- **Autonomous Decision Making** - Agent independently decides responses based on conversation context
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior** - Works toward completing sales objectives (information collection, objection handling)
- **Multi-Modal Tool Usage** - Integrates and orchestrates multiple AI tools (STT, LLM, TTS)
- **Real-time Adaptation** - Dynamically adjusts conversation flow based on customer responses
- **Memory & Context** - Maintains conversation state and customer information throughout interaction
- **Structured Reasoning** - Follows business logic while adapting to natural conversation patterns

### Agentic AI Framework: 
**LiveKit Agents Framework** provides the foundation for building production-ready agentic AI systems:
- **Agent Session Management** - Handles multi-turn conversations with state persistence
- **Tool Integration** - Seamless orchestration of AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Deepgram)
- **Real-time Processing** - Sub-second response times for natural conversation flow
- **Scalable Architecture** - Cloud-native design for enterprise deployment
- **Voice Activity Detection** - Intelligent conversation turn management
- **Error Recovery** - Robust handling of network issues and service interruptions

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Automate customer calling** for financial product sales
- **Implement conversational AI** with Indian accent and cultural context
- **Handle objections** and collect customer information systematically
- **Provide real-time interaction** using advanced AI technologies
